    <h1>Hello There</h1>
    <p>My name is Najwan Aribena Pratama, you can just call me 'wan'. Actually programming is my hobby, I prefer to swim, workout, and play guitar in my spare time. Because sometimes I get bored playing games. And of course spending time with family & friends is a good thing. I am currently studying at SMKN 4 Bandung. By majoring in Software Engineering. Because I am interested in Software Development. Very excited about learning new technology, also enthusiast about achieving goals, and always optimist at work. If there is something ask, i will be happy to answer.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Best Regards,<br/>Najwan Aribena</p>
